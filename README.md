# Sustainable Playwright Architecture

A maintainable and scalable Playwright test architecture focused on sustainability through clear separation of concerns.

## Core Principles

- **Reviewability**: Easy to understand and review
- **Maintainability**: Resilient to changes
- **Sustainability**: Transferable and long-lasting

## Architecture Overview

This architecture separates concerns across 4 distinct layers:

1. **Layer 1: Page Objects** - UI element definitions and basic operations
2. **Layer 2: Actions** - Business logic and multi-page flows
3. **Layer 3: Tests** - Test scenarios and assertions (AAA pattern)
4. **Layer 4: Config/Env** - Environment configuration and settings
